# Gather.town Wiki
This is an unofficial, community-led wiki forÂ [Gather.town](http://gather.town/)Â users.
It exists so we can better organize the stream of helpful information and resources in theÂ [Gather Enthusiasts Discord server](https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6)Â (and elsewhere on the internet).
It's especially intended to be a source of community-generated documentation for Gather.town's API - which is quite fun to use, but has extremely incomplete official documentation. Let's help address that together.

To explore the wiki, click on "ðŸ“–Wiki" in the bar above, [or just click here](https://github.com/gvivster/GatherTown-Wiki/wiki).

If the wiki is useful to you, please consider [donating a small amount to its maintainer](https://ko-fi.com/gvguide). I'd really appreciate it! - Evie ðŸ™‚
