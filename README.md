# Gather.town Wiki
This is an unofficial, community-led wiki forÂ [Gather.town](http://gather.town/)Â users.

It exists so we can better organize the stream of helpful information and resources in theÂ [Gather Enthusiasts Discord server](https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6)Â (and elsewhere on the internet).

`_If this wiki is useful to you, please consider_`Â [`_donating a small amount to its maintainer_`](https://ko-fi.com/gvguide). I'd really appreciate it! - Evie ðŸ™‚_`

# How to Use This Wiki

**Add content and resources.**Â Let me know in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6) if you'd like to contribute here, and I'll be happy to add you.

**Explain it like we're five.**Â I'd like this wiki to be a resource for beginners. (This goes especially for API information, because its official documentation is quite incomplete - overexplaining API stuff will be better than underexplaining.)

# Official Gather links

-   [Help Center](https://support.gather.town/help): Basic documentation for getting started.
-   [Forum](https://forum.gather.town/): If you're working with the API, this is a good place to be. Gather devs are more likely to see what you post here.
-   [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gatheroffices/shared_invite/zt-1gcnymehu-oyQCdFWnO0qPtfKskGD4KQ): Gather's official Slack channel has a lot of employees in it that get paid to answer official help questions. (Slack's not as much my thing as Discord is, but if it's yours, go put 'em to work! ðŸ˜‰)
-   [Notion](https://gathertown.notion.site/Gather-Community-edabf2acf7e04e77b1c556811d5bff3e): More documentation, but unlikely to be up-to-date.

# More awesome unofficial resources

-   [Gather Enthusiasts Discord server](https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6): where the user community got started! A great place for quick feedback, idea-bouncing, job postings, event postings and more.
-   [r/gathertown](https://www.reddit.com/r/gathertown/): A decently active subreddit.
-   [The original Fandom wiki](https://gathertown.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Wiki): I'll leave this link here until all the information can be transferred. (Many thanks to Jommi, who kindly set this up on his own time.)
-   [Public list of Gather spaces](https://gathertown.spread.name/): A curated list of spaces. You can add yours too!
-   [Bill's GT-Helper](https://forum.gather.town/t/gt-helper-project-builder-tool-for-gather-websocket-extensions/424): Project builder tool for Gather websocket extensions. An amazing resource for those just getting started with the API.
