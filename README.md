# Gather.town [Wiki](https://github.com/gvivster/GatherTown-Wiki/wiki)
This repository hosts an unofficial, community-led wiki for [Gather.town](http://gather.town/) users.
It exists so we can better organize the stream of helpful information and resources in the [Gather Enthusiasts Discord server](https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6) (and elsewhere on the internet).

**It's especially intended to be a source of community-generated documentation for Gather.town's API** - which is quite fun to use, but has extremely incomplete official documentation. Let's help address that together. A rising tide lifts all ships.

If the wiki is useful to you, please consider [donating a small amount to its maintainer](https://ko-fi.com/gvguide). I'd really appreciate it! - Evie 🙂
